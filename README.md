# Space Shooter Arena 2D

## About
My first 2D multiplayer space shooter game built with Python using Pygame. Control spaceships, dodge bullets, and battle against a friend. Simple, fun, and a great learning experience!

## Features
- **Two-player local multiplayer:** Battle it out with a friend on the same keyboard.
- **Smooth controls:** Responsive movement with WASD (Yellow) and Arrow Keys (Red).
- **Shooting mechanics:** Fire up to 3 bullets at a time.
- **Health system:** First to deplete their opponent's health wins.
- **Custom sound effects:** Enjoy immersive audio for shooting and hits.
- **Custom graphics:** Unique spaceship sprites and a space-themed background.

## Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Gameplay
- **Objective:** Reduce your opponent’s health to zero to win.
- **Yellow vs. Red:** Use your spaceship’s agility and firepower to outmaneuver your opponent.

## Future Plans
- Add power-ups and special abilities.
- Implement AI for single-player mode.
- Expand to online multiplayer.
